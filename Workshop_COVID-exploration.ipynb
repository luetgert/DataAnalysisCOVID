    "Today we will turn to using our knowledge of Python to work with data. This is an exciting step because we will learn to take data (of any size or shape!) and open it up to understand and visualize the information inside. We can observe trends and patterns over time, test our hypotheses about how thing work and identify empirical evidence to support or refute our claims. We will begin with two important libraries in Python- pandas and plotly. Pandas will give us the ability to frame inputed vectors of information as a data frame. In other words, we do not have disjointed vectors of information (or labelled lists), we can conceive of these as representing features, or describing characteristics/ independent variables, that are pasted together in one data frame. In a data frame, the columns are these features, the rows are the observations, or individuals in our sample. We will then use plotly to visualize some of our data trends. Today we look first at individuals with COVID19 symptoms in Canada."

    "Python includes many libraries for visualizing data. The most basic library is matplotlib. The seaborn library includes more detailed display options and presets for several common plot types. Here we explore plotly. This library (along with Bokeh) offers us exceptional interactive data plots with features such as hover points to help our readers interact and understand our data visualizations. Below, we will define the figure, set the labels and title and show the figure. Note that we are saving the plot as an html file to protect the interactive nature of this plot for sharing with others. We could also save it as a static plot if we needed it for a print document. For a complete explanation of the plotly library, please refer to the documentation https://plotly.com/python/"
